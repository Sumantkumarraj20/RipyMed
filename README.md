Tech Stack:

Frontend: Next.js 13+ (App Router), Tailwind CSS

Database: Firebase Firestore (with proper indexing)

Auth: Firebase Authentication

State Management: React Context + Zustand (for complex state)

Form Handling: React Hook Form

Visualization: Recharts/Chart.js

Testing: Jest + React Testing Library

Key Data Structures:

config/
  └── global (contains examTypes, metadata)

examTypes/            ← Individual exam config
  └── {examTypeId} (e.g., "usmle-step-1")
        ├── subjects/
        │   └── {subjectId}
        ├── systems/
        │   └── {systemId}
        └── metadata (blockDuration, perBlockQuestions, etc.)

questions/            ← Contains question docs
  └── {questionId}

users/
  └── {uid}
        └── userQuestionData/
              └── {questionId}

Core Features Implemented:

Test Configuration System:

Dynamic question filtering (subject/system/difficulty)

Multiple test modes (Tutor/Timed/ user can cho)

Real-time question availability calculation

Config persistence via sessionStorage

Test Interface:

Exam-like environment with:

Timed blocks

Question flagging

Lab values reference

Calculator tool

Adaptive rendering based on:

Font size preferences

Color schemes

Accessibility needs

Analytics Dashboard:

Performance breakdown by:

Subject area

System category

Difficulty level

Weakness identification

Time management analysis

Optimization Strategies Applied:

Data Fetching:

Chunked Firestore queries (batches of 10)

SWR for client-side caching

Pre-fetching adjacent questions

Performance:

Virtualized lists for long question banks

Memoized components

Lazy-loaded heavy components (lab values, calculator)

Maintenance:

Strict TypeScript enforcement

Modular service architecture

Comprehensive error boundaries

Automated Firestore indexes

Development Path Forward:

Immediate Next Steps:

Implement server-side test result processing

Develop spaced repetition algorithm

Build admin question upload interface

Add multiplayer study sessions

Maintenance Priorities:

Automated backup system for user data

Performance monitoring integration

Comprehensive test coverage

Documentation system for future developers

Key Architectural Decisions to Maintain:

Client-side filtering for test interface

Firestore denormalization for read performance

Stateless session management

Progressive enhancement approach

This summary provides complete context for continuing development while maintaining the established patterns and optimizations. The architecture balances performance with maintainability through:

Clear separation of concerns

Type-driven development

Optimized data fetching patterns

Modular component design

Strategic Firestore data modeling
